# N-long name
## Instructions:

Write a RISC-V program that asks the user to write his name, then calculate
the number of characters his name contains, and finally print the following
message: “Your name is N characters long”, where N is the number of
characters. Recall that string read using system calls ends with the “\n”,
represented by 1010 or 10 in decimal.
