## Introduction

The **ARCHI-20-DAYS-RISC-V-CHALLENGE** is designed to help you dive deep into the world of RISC-V architecture. Over 20 days, you'll work on various challenges that will enhance your understanding of RISC-V instructions, assembly programming, and low-level system design.

Each day presents a new challenge, ranging from basic instruction manipulation to more complex tasks like implementing algorithms in RISC-V assembly. This project is perfect for anyone looking to strengthen their skills in computer architecture, assembly programming, and embedded systems.

## Challenges

Here’s a brief overview of what you'll encounter during the challenge:

- **Day 1-5:** Basic RISC-V Instructions and Operations
- **Day 6-10:** Control Flow and Conditional Branching
- **Day 11-15:** Memory Management and Arrays
- **Day 16-20:** Algorithm Implementation and Optimization

Each challenge will have its own folder containing the problem statement, example code, and a solution in RISC-V assembly.

## Getting Started

To get started with this challenge:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ARCHI-20-DAYS-RISC-V-CHALLENGE.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the day's challenge directory:
    ```sh
    cd ARCHI-20-DAYS-RISC-V-CHALLENGE/Day1
    ```
3. Read the challenge instructions and start coding!

## Requirements

To complete the challenges, you’ll need:

- A RISC-V simulator or emulator (e.g., Spike, RARS)
- A text editor or IDE with support for assembly language
- Basic knowledge of assembly language programming

## How to Use

Each day's challenge folder includes:

- **README.md:** Explains the challenge for the day.
- **challenge.s:** The template file where you will write your RISC-V assembly code.
- **solution.s:** A reference solution for the challenge.

You can follow these steps to solve a challenge:

1. Open the `challenge.s` file and write your solution.
2. Test your code using a RISC-V simulator.
3. Compare your solution with `solution.s` if needed.
